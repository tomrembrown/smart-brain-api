# API for Smart Brain

This is the server REST API for the smart brain web application. People log in
and insert pictures, and then ask the Clarifai API to determine people's faces in the
pictures.

Please be sure to adjust environment variables in either .env.production or .env.development and then copy to the .env which isn't stored in the github repo.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the server using node - it awaits REST calls
